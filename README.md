## üïí RTC Support (DS1307/DS3231)

This project supports both **DS1307** and **DS3231** RTC modules for accurate timekeeping.  
- By default, the code uses DS1307.  
- To use DS3231, uncomment the relevant line in the code (`RTC_DS3231 rtc;`) and comment out the DS1307 line before uploading.
- Both modules connect via I2C (SDA/SCL) to the ESP8266.
- RTC time can be updated from the **Settings** page in the web interface.

> **Note:** The RTC keeps time even when the ESP8266 is powered off. Time synchronization from NTP is only required after initial setup or if the RTC loses power.

## üåü Features

- **üéõÔ∏è Multiple Control Modes**
  - Manual Toggle Control
  - Automatic Scheduling
  - Timer-based Operation
  - Toggle Mode with On/Off intervals

- **‚ö° Real-time Controls**
  - 2 Independent Relay Channels
  - Individual Relay Naming
  - Status Monitoring
  - Connection Status Indicator

- **‚è∞ Time Management**
  - NTP Time Synchronization (manual update via Settings page)
  - Uses pool.ntp.org servers for time sync
  - Automatic Time Updates with fallback servers
  - Time Accuracy depends on RTC module (DS1307/DS3231)
  - Persistent Scheduling
  - Requires WiFi connection for NTP sync
  > üìù **Note**: This version relies on RTC for time management. Time can be updated from NTP manually via the Settings page. For offline operation or exact timing, DS3231 is recommended for higher accuracy.

- **üé® Modern UI**
  - Responsive Design
  - Dark Theme
  - Touch-friendly Interface
  - Real-time Status Updates

- **üõ†Ô∏è System Features**
  - OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates
  - LittleFS File System
  - Persistent Configuration Storage
  - RESTful API Endpoints

## üîÑ Scalability

This system is highly scalable and can be easily modified to control more or fewer relays:

1. **Hardware Scaling**
   - Simply adjust the number of relays and GPIO pins in the main program
   - Update pin definitions in the configuration section

2. **Interface Scaling**
   - Modify the relay count in the JavaScript array: `[1, 2]`
   - Add or remove corresponding div blocks in `index.html` and `settings.html`
   - The web interface automatically adapts to the number of configured relays

3. **Memory Considerations**
   - ESP8266 can theoretically handle up to 16 relays
   - Each relay requires approximately:
     - 2KB of program memory
     - 100 bytes of RAM for state management
     - Minimal impact on web interface size

> üí° **Scaling Tip**: When modifying the number of relays, ensure you update all three components:
> 1. Hardware GPIO definitions
> 2. JavaScript relay array
> 3. HTML interface elements

## üîß Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Development Board (or any compatible ESP8266 module)
- 2-Channel Relay Module
- RTC Module: DS1307 (default) or DS3231 (select in code before uploading)
- Power Supply (5V)
- Stable WiFi Connection (2.4GHz network with internet access for NTP)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: RTC module is required for timekeeping. DS3231 is recommended for higher accuracy and reliability. Internet connectivity is only needed for time synchronization via NTP (manual update).

> üí° **Compatibility**: This project is developed and tested on the ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Kit.  
> It has been tested on **NodeMCU 1.0** and **LOLIN (Wemos) D1 R2 Mini** boards.  
> It works with other ESP8266-based boards with minimal changes. Ensure your board has enough GPIO pins for relays and I2C (SDA/SCL) for RTC.

### Circuit Diagram
![Hardware Connections](src/schematics.png)

The above schematic shows the connections between the ESP8266 and relay module. Make sure to follow the pin connections exactly as shown for proper functionality.

## üì¶ Dependencies

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The following specific libraries are required for compatibility. Using different versions may cause stability issues.

- ESP8266WiFi (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncTCP) - **Required Version**
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer) - **Required Version**
- LittleFS (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- ArduinoJson
- ElegantOTA
- NTPClient

All libraries can be installed through the Arduino Library Manager. These specific libraries are mandatory for proper functionality of the ElegantOTA system.

## üïí NTP Time Offset and Server Selection

The code uses the following line to initialize the NTP client:
```cpp
NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, "in.pool.ntp.org", 19800);
```
- The third parameter, `19800`, is the time offset in **seconds** for your timezone.
- `19800` seconds = **5 hours 30 minutes** (5 √ó 3600 + 30 √ó 60), which is the offset for **Indian Standard Time (IST, UTC+5:30)**.
- If you are in a different timezone, calculate your offset in seconds and update this value accordingly.

**How to calculate your offset:**
- Offset (in seconds) = (Hours √ó 3600) + (Minutes √ó 60)
- Example for UTC+2: (2 √ó 3600) = `7200`

**Default NTP Server:**
- The default NTP server is set to `"in.pool.ntp.org"` (India).
- For best accuracy, select the NTP pool server nearest to your location from [https://www.ntppool.org/en/zone/in](https://www.ntppool.org/en/zone/in) or [https://www.ntppool.org/](https://www.ntppool.org/).

**To change:**
- Replace `"in.pool.ntp.org"` with your region's NTP pool server (e.g., `"europe.pool.ntp.org"`, `"us.pool.ntp.org"`, etc.).
- Adjust the offset to match your local timezone.

Example for Central European Time (CET, UTC+1):
```cpp
NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, "europe.pool.ntp.org", 3600);
```

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desiFish/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1-Lite.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE

3. Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager

4. Configure WiFi credentials in Smart-AquariumV3_1Lite.ino:
   ```cpp
   const char *ssid = "YourWiFiName";
   const char *password = "YourWiFiPassword";
   ```

5. Initial Setup (Wired Upload - One time only):
   - Connect ESP8266 to your computer via USB
   - Install "ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload" tool in Arduino IDE ([Installation Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/))
   - Ensure the `data` folder contains `index.html`, `settings.html`, and `favicon.jpg` with exact folder structure
   - Upload HTML files using the guide above
   - Upload the code from Arduino IDE
   - After successful code upload, the device will connect to your configured network
   
6. Filesystem and Future Updates (Wireless/OTA):
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` in Arduino IDE (or follow the [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/)) to launch ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload tool
   - **Note:** The LittleFS uploader tool requires a COM port to be selected, even if the ESP8266 is not connected. You must select a port such as `COM3 [Not Connected]` in the Arduino IDE. If no COM port is available, the upload will fail.
   - When it fails (as ESP8266 is not connected via USB), check the error message
   - Locate the generated binary file path from the error message (usually in the temporary build folder)
   ![LittleFS Binary Location](src/littleFS.jpg)     
   - Access the ElegantOTA interface at `http://[ESP-IP]/update`
   - For filesystem updates: Select "Filesystem" mode and upload the LittleFS binary (.bin)
   - For code updates: Select "Firmware" mode and upload the generated .bin file after compiling the sketch in Arduino IDE

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Persistence**: When updating the filesystem through OTA, all configuration data stored in LittleFS will be erased. You'll need to:
> - Rename relays
> - Reset schedules and timers
> - Reconfigure any custom settings
> This only applies to filesystem updates, not firmware updates.

> üìö **Reference Guides**:
> - [ElegantOTA Basic Usage Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-ota-elegantota-arduino/)
> - [ElegantOTA Async Configuration](https://docs.elegantota.pro/getting-started/async-mode)

> üí° **Tip**: After the initial wired upload, all future updates can be done wirelessly through ElegantOTA. This includes both code and filesystem updates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Troubleshooting

> üî¥ **Critical**: If the server fails to start or the code doesn't work, the most common cause is incorrect static IP configuration. You have two options:
> 1. **Remove Static IP**: Comment out or remove the static IP configuration code to use DHCP (recommended for beginners)
> 2. **Configure Static IP**: Ensure your static IP settings match your network configuration:
>    ```cpp
>    IPAddress local_IP(192, 168, 1, 200);     // Choose an unused IP in your network
>    IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);        // Your router's IP address
>    IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);       // Your network's subnet mask
>    ```
> Most connection issues are resolved by either switching to DHCP or correctly configuring these values!
