## üîÑ Scalability

This system is highly scalable and can be easily modified to control more or fewer relays:

1. **Hardware Scaling**
   - Simply adjust the number of relays and GPIO pins in the main program
   - Update pin definitions in the configuration section

2. **Interface Scaling**
   - Modify the relay count in the JavaScript array: `[1, 2]`
   - Add or remove corresponding div blocks in `index.html` and `settings.html`
   - The web interface automatically adapts to the number of configured relays

3. **Memory Considerations**
   - ESP8266 can theoretically handle up to 16 relays
   - Each relay requires approximately:
     - 2KB of program memory
     - 100 bytes of RAM for state management
     - Minimal impact on web interface size

> üí° **Scaling Tip**: When modifying the number of relays, ensure you update all three components:
> 1. Hardware GPIO definitions
> 2. JavaScript relay array
> 3. HTML interface elements

## üîß Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Development Board (or any compatible ESP8266 module)
- 2-Channel Relay Module
- Power Supply (5V)
- Stable WiFi Connection (2.4GHz network with internet access for NTP)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This version requires constant internet connectivity for time synchronization. Power or internet outages will affect timing accuracy until reconnection.

> üí° **Compatibility**: While this project is developed and tested on the ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Kit, it should work on other ESP8266-based development boards with minimal modifications. Just ensure your board has enough GPIO pins for the relay and RTC connections.

### ESP8266 Pinout

### Circuit Diagram
![Hardware Connections](src/schematics.png)

The above schematic shows the connections between the ESP8266 and relay module. Make sure to follow the pin connections exactly as shown for proper functionality.

## üì¶ Dependencies

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The following specific libraries are required for compatibility. Using different versions may cause stability issues.

- ESP8266WiFi (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncTCP) - **Required Version**
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer) - **Required Version**
- LittleFS (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- ArduinoJson
- ElegantOTA
- NTPClient

All libraries can be installed through the Arduino Library Manager. These specific libraries are mandatory for proper functionality of the ElegantOTA system.

## üåê NTP Server Selection

For accurate time synchronization, this project uses NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers. By default, it uses `pool.ntp.org`, which automatically selects a server for you. However, for improved reliability and lower latency, you can specify a regional NTP pool server closer to your location.

- **Why choose a regional server?**
  - Faster response times
  - Reduced risk of timeouts
  - Less load on global NTP infrastructure

### How to select your nearest NTP server

1. Visit the [NTP Pool Project zone list](https://www.ntppool.org/en/).
2. Find your country or region. For example, for India, use:  
   [`in.pool.ntp.org`](https://www.ntppool.org/en/zone/in)
3. Replace the default NTP server in your code with the regional pool address.  
   Example for India:
   ```cpp
   const char* ntpServer = "in.pool.ntp.org";
   ```
4. For other regions, use the corresponding pool address (e.g., `us.pool.ntp.org`, `eu.pool.ntp.org`, etc.).

> üí° **Tip:** Always choose the pool closest to your physical location for best results.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desiFish/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1-Lite.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE

3. Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager

4. Configure WiFi credentials in Smart-AquariumV3_1Lite.ino:
   ```cpp
   const char *ssid = "YourWiFiName";
   const char *password = "YourWiFiPassword";
   ```

5. Initial Setup (Wired Upload - One time only):
   - Connect ESP8266 to your computer via USB
   - Install "ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload" tool in Arduino IDE ([Installation Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/))
   - Ensure the `data` folder contains `index.html`, `settings.html`, and `favicon.jpg` with exact folder structure
   - Upload HTML files using the guide above
   - Upload the code from Arduino IDE
   - After successful code upload, the device will connect to your configured network
   
6. Filesystem and Future Updates (Wireless/OTA):
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` in Arduino IDE (or follow the [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/)) to launch ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload tool
   - When it fails (as ESP8266 is not connected via USB), check the error message
   - Locate the generated binary file path from the error message (usually in the temporary build folder)
   ![LittleFS Binary Location](src/littleFS.jpg)     
   - Access the ElegantOTA interface at `http://[ESP-IP]/update`
   - For filesystem updates: Select "Filesystem" mode and upload the LittleFS binary (.bin)
   - For code updates: Select "Firmware" mode and upload the generated .bin file after compiling the sketch in Arduino IDE

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Persistence**: When updating the filesystem through OTA, all configuration data stored in LittleFS will be erased. You'll need to:
> - Rename relays
> - Reset schedules and timers
> - Reconfigure any custom settings
> This only applies to filesystem updates, not firmware updates.

> üìö **Reference Guides**:
> - [ElegantOTA Basic Usage Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-ota-elegantota-arduino/)
> - [ElegantOTA Async Configuration](https://docs.elegantota.pro/getting-started/async-mode)

> üí° **Tip**: After the initial wired upload, all future updates can be done wirelessly through ElegantOTA. This includes both code and filesystem updates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Troubleshooting

> üî¥ **Critical**: If the server fails to start or the code doesn't work, the most common cause is incorrect static IP configuration. You have two options:
> 1. **Remove Static IP**: Comment out or remove the static IP configuration code to use DHCP (recommended for beginners)
> 2. **Configure Static IP**: Ensure your static IP settings match your network configuration:
>    ```cpp
>    IPAddress local_IP(192, 168, 1, 200);     // Choose an unused IP in your network
>    IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);        // Your router's IP address
>    IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);       // Your network's subnet mask
>    ```
> Most connection issues are resolved by either switching to DHCP or correctly configuring these values!
